# Delete Command Implementation Tasks Report

## Overview

Successfully created 10 tasks for implementing the delete command feature in Simple Task Master (STM). The tasks are organized into 4 phases with proper dependencies and priorities.

## Tasks Created

### Phase 1 - Foundation (2 tasks)
- **Task 1118**: Create delete command file structure
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: none
  
- **Task 1119**: Register delete command in CLI
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1118

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation (3 tasks)
- **Task 1120**: Implement basic delete functionality
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1118, 1119
  
- **Task 1121**: Configure Commander.js command definition
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1120
  
- **Task 1122**: Implement dependency validation
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1120

### Phase 3 - Testing (3 tasks)
- **Task 1123**: Create unit tests for delete command
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1120, 1122
  
- **Task 1124**: Create integration tests
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1120, 1122
  
- **Task 1125**: Create end-to-end CLI tests
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1120, 1122

### Phase 4 - Documentation and Polish (2 tasks)
- **Task 1126**: Update README with delete command
  - Priority: medium
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: 1120, 1121, 1122, 1123, 1124, 1125
  
- **Task 1127**: Run comprehensive validation
  - Priority: high
  - Status: pending
  - Dependencies: all previous tasks (1118-1126)

**Note**: There are duplicate tasks from a previous run (IDs 1108-1117). The tasks listed above (1118-1127) are the current set to be implemented.

## Implementation Order

### Critical Path
1. Task 1118 → Task 1119 → Task 1120 → Tasks 1121, 1122 (parallel) → Tasks 1123, 1124, 1125 (parallel) → Task 1126 → Task 1127

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Phase 2: Tasks 1121 and 1122 can be done after 1120
- Phase 3: All testing tasks (1123, 1124, 1125) can be done in parallel after Phase 2
- Phase 4: Task 1126 can start once Phase 3 completes

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Basic Delete Functionality**
   - Delete tasks by ID
   - Error handling for invalid/non-existent tasks
   - Clear success/error messages

2. **Dependency Protection**
   - Prevents deletion of tasks with dependents
   - Lists all dependent tasks in error message
   - Provides guidance on removing dependencies

3. **CLI Integration**
   - Command aliases: rm, remove
   - Proper help text and examples
   - Consistent with existing CLI patterns

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests with mocking
   - Integration tests with file system
   - End-to-end CLI workflow tests

## Next Steps

1. Start with Task 1118: Create the delete command file structure
2. Progress through phases in order
3. Use `stm update [task-id] --status in-progress` when starting a task
4. Mark tasks complete with `stm update [task-id] --status done`
5. Run validation checks after each phase

## Useful Commands

```bash
# View all delete command tasks
stm list --tags delete-command

# View tasks for a specific phase
stm list --tags phase-1
stm list --tags phase-2
stm list --tags phase-3
stm list --tags phase-4

# View task details
stm show [task-id]

# Start working on a task
stm update [task-id] --status in-progress

# Mark task as complete
stm update [task-id] --status done
```

## Success Criteria

The delete command implementation is complete when:
- All 10 tasks are marked as done
- All quality checks pass (lint, typecheck, tests)
- Documentation is updated
- Manual testing confirms all functionality works correctly
