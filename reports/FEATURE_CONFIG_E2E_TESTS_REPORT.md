# Feature Completion Report: Config Command E2E Tests

**Date:** 2025-07-24
**Task:** Create E2E tests for config workflows
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully created comprehensive end-to-end tests for the config command workflows in `/test/e2e/config-e2e.spec.ts`. All 13 tests pass successfully, providing thorough coverage of config command functionality, error handling, and integration scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### Test File Structure
- **Location:** `/test/e2e/config-e2e.spec.ts`
- **Framework:** Vitest with CLITestRunner for real CLI execution
- **Test Count:** 13 tests organized into 7 test suites
- **Execution Time:** ~4 seconds

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Full Workflow Testing (1 test)
- Complete lifecycle: init → config changes → task operations
- Verifies config persistence across multiple changes
- Ensures tasks remain accessible after config updates
- Tests interaction between config changes and task operations

#### 2. TasksDir Management (2 tests)
- **Existing tasks handling:** Tests directory changes with existing tasks
- **Security validation:** Validates path traversal prevention, absolute paths, and system directories
- Verifies warning messages when changing directories with existing tasks
- Tests task accessibility after directory switches

#### 3. Script Integration (2 tests)
- **Script-friendly output:** Single values for `--get`, JSON for `--list`
- **Error handling:** Graceful handling of missing/invalid configuration keys
- Validates output format for shell scripting usage
- Tests piping scenarios and value parsing

#### 4. Error Recovery (2 tests)
- **Corrupted config:** Tests graceful recovery from invalid JSON
- **Missing config:** Ensures backward compatibility with default values
- Verifies error messages are helpful and actionable
- Tests config recreation after corruption

#### 5. Multiple Config Changes (2 tests)
- **Sequential updates:** Rapid configuration changes in sequence
- **Concurrent operations:** Simulates multiple STM instances
- Tests lock contention handling
- Verifies final state consistency

#### 6. Performance Testing (2 tests)
- **Large values:** Tests efficiency with maximum allowed values
- **Validation performance:** Tests rapid validation of invalid inputs
- Ensures operations complete within reasonable timeframes
- Tests batch read operations

#### 7. Integration Testing (2 tests)
- **maxTaskSizeBytes:** Verifies size limits are enforced during task creation
- **lockTimeoutMs:** Tests timeout behavior during concurrent operations
- Ensures config values are respected by other commands

### Key Features Tested

✅ **Real CLI Execution:** All tests use CLITestRunner for authentic command execution
✅ **Output Validation:** Verifies both stdout and stderr for expected messages
✅ **Error Scenarios:** Comprehensive error handling and recovery testing
✅ **Performance:** Includes timing assertions for operation efficiency
✅ **Concurrency:** Tests lock contention and concurrent access scenarios
✅ **Security:** Validates path traversal and system directory protections
✅ **Integration:** Tests config impact on other STM commands

### CLITestRunner Enhancements

Added three config-specific methods to the CLITestRunner:
```typescript
async configGet(key: string): Promise<CLIResult>
async configSet(key: string, value: string): Promise<CLIResult>
async configList(): Promise<CLIResult>
```

These methods provide convenient wrappers for config operations while maintaining consistency with other test utilities.

```

## Validation Criteria Met

✅ **Complete workflows tested:** Full init → config → task operation flows
✅ **Real CLI execution verified:** All tests use actual CLI commands via CLITestRunner
✅ **Output format validated:** Both success and error outputs verified
✅ **Error scenarios tested:** Corruption, missing files, invalid values, concurrent access
✅ **Performance acceptable:** All operations complete within defined timeframes

## Technical Highlights

1. **Robust Error Handling:** Tests cover corrupted JSON, missing files, invalid values, and concurrent access conflicts
2. **Platform Compatibility:** Tests account for platform differences in path validation
3. **Realistic Scenarios:** Tests simulate real-world usage patterns including scripting and concurrent access
4. **Performance Awareness:** Includes timing assertions to ensure operations remain efficient
5. **Security Focus:** Validates protection against path traversal and system directory access

## Conclusion

The config command E2E test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all config workflows, ensuring the feature works reliably across various scenarios. The tests are well-structured, maintainable, and provide confidence in the config command's functionality and error handling capabilities.
