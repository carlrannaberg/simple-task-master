# Task Decomposition Summary: Configurable Task Directory

**Generated**: 2025-07-22  
**Specification**: specs/feat-configurable-task-directory.md  
**Task Management System**: STM (Simple Task Master)

## Overview

Successfully decomposed the Configurable Task Directory feature specification into 12 actionable tasks organized across 3 implementation phases. All tasks have been created in STM with full technical details, dependencies, and validation criteria.

## Task Breakdown Summary

### Total Tasks: 12

#### Phase 1: Foundation (3 tasks)
- Task 1: Create ConfigManager class for configuration loading
- Task 2: Update Config interface with tasksDir field  
- Task 3: Create comprehensive unit tests for ConfigManager

#### Phase 2: Core Integration (4 tasks)
- Task 4: Integrate ConfigManager with TaskManager
- Task 5: Update workspace discovery functions
- Task 6: Add --tasks-dir option to init command
- Task 7: Create integration tests for custom directories

#### Phase 3: Polish and Edge Cases (5 tasks)
- Task 8: Implement gitignore handling for custom directories
- Task 9: Add security validation for path traversal
- Task 10: Create E2E tests for CLI workflows
- Task 11: Update documentation and README
- Task 12: Performance validation and optimization

## Task Dependencies

```
Phase 1: Foundation
├── Task 1 (ConfigManager) ──┬──→ Task 3 (Unit tests)
└── Task 2 (Interface) ──────┘

Phase 2: Core Integration  
├── Tasks 1,2 ──→ Task 4 (TaskManager) ──┐
├── Task 1 ────→ Task 5 (Workspace) ─────┤──→ Task 7 (Integration tests)
└── Tasks 1,2 ──→ Task 6 (Init command) ─┘

Phase 3: Polish
├── Task 6 ──┬──→ Task 8 (Gitignore)
│            ├──→ Task 9 (Security)
│            └──→ Task 10 (E2E tests)
└── All ─────┬──→ Task 11 (Documentation)
             └──→ Task 12 (Performance)
```

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

1. **Phase 1**: Tasks 1 and 2 can run in parallel (no dependencies)
2. **Phase 2**: Tasks 4 and 5 can run in parallel after Phase 1 completes
3. **Phase 3**: Tasks 8, 9, and 10 can run in parallel after Task 6

## Critical Path

The shortest path to a working feature:
1. Task 1: Create ConfigManager (foundation)
2. Task 6: Add --tasks-dir to init command (core functionality)
3. Task 7: Integration tests (validation)
4. Task 10: E2E tests (complete validation)

## Key Implementation Details Preserved

Each STM task includes:
- Complete technical requirements from the specification
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Code examples and specific function signatures
- Acceptance criteria matching the spec
- Proper dependencies for execution order
- Tags for filtering and organization

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Security**: Task 9 specifically addresses path traversal attacks
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Multiple tasks ensure existing workspaces continue working
3. **Testing**: 4 dedicated testing tasks (unit, integration, E2E, performance)
4. **Documentation**: Dedicated task for user-facing documentation

## Execution Strategy Recommendations

1. **Start with Phase 1** to establish the foundation
2. **Focus on Tasks 1, 2, 4, and 6** for MVP functionality
3. **Run tests continuously** as implementation progresses
4. **Defer Tasks 11 and 12** until core functionality is stable

## STM Commands for Task Management

View all tasks:
```bash
stm list --pretty
```

View Phase 1 tasks:
```bash
stm list --tags phase1 --pretty
```

View high priority tasks:
```bash
stm list --tags priority-high --pretty
```

Start working on a task:
```bash
stm update <task-id> --status in-progress
```
