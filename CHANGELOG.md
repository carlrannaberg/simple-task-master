and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Configurable Task Directory**
  - Initialize STM with custom task directory using `stm init --tasks-dir <path>`
  - Support for both relative and absolute paths (with security restrictions)
  - Automatic `.gitignore` updates for custom directories
  - Configuration stored in `config.json` with `tasksDir` field
  - Path validation to prevent directory traversal and system directory usage
  - Support for existing directories with warning for non-empty ones
  - Migration guide for moving existing tasks to custom directories

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-20

### Added

- **Delete Command (`stm delete`)**
  - Complete CRUD functionality with task deletion capability
  - Dependency validation to prevent breaking task relationships
  - Support for both standard `dependencies` and unknown field `depends_on` formats
  - Force flag (`--force`) to bypass dependency checks when needed
  - Comprehensive error handling with proper exit codes
  - Full test coverage including unit, integration, and E2E tests

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-20

### Added

- **Unknown Field Support for External Tool Integration**
  - Tasks now support arbitrary custom metadata fields beyond core STM fields
  - External tools can add their own fields without modifying STM
  - Full support through CLI, library API, and direct file manipulation
  - Added comprehensive integration guide with examples for AutoAgent, GitHub Actions, JIRA
  - Field count limit of 100 fields per task for performance protection

### Changed

- **Enhanced Schema Validation**
  - Modified validation to preserve unknown fields while maintaining strict validation for core fields
  - Core STM fields (id, title, status, etc.) remain strictly validated
  - Unknown fields are preserved without type validation
  - Config and LockFile validation remains unchanged (strict)

- **Improved Update Command**
  - Now accepts arbitrary field names in key=value assignments
  - Unknown fields can be set to any value, including empty strings
  - Array operations (+=, -=) remain limited to known array fields
  - Better error messages for invalid field names

### Fixed

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Resolved all ESLint errors (238 â†’ 0)
  - Replaced `any` types with proper type aliases for better type safety
  - Fixed unused variables and imports
  - Corrected line length violations
  - Added missing newlines at end of files

### Technical

- Added `[key: string]: unknown` index signature to Task, TaskCreateInput, and TaskUpdateInput interfaces
- Created 76 new tests covering unknown field functionality
- Added performance benchmarks for tasks with many unknown fields
- Documented field naming conventions and best practices

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-19

### Enhanced

- **Enhanced Update Command (`stm update`)**
  - Added section-specific content editing with `--desc`, `--details`, and `--validation` flags
  - Implemented stdin support using `-` for piping content into specific sections
  - Added editor integration that launches when no changes are specified
  - Introduced flexible key=value assignment syntax for all task properties
  - Added array operation support with `+=` (add) and `-=` (remove) operators
  - Enhanced command help text with comprehensive descriptions
  - Improved workflow integration for CI/CD and testing pipelines
  - Added support for multi-line content updates via heredoc and piping

  - `stm update` - Update task properties including status, title, priority, tags, and due dates
  - `stm grep` - Search tasks using regular expressions with field-specific filtering
  - `stm export` - Export tasks to JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats

- **Task Storage System**
  - Individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter for each task
  - Human-readable task files with support for rich content
  - Automatic task ID generation and management

  - Automatic .gitignore management to exclude task files

- **Output Formats and Filtering**
  - Multiple output formats: JSON, table, CSV, and pretty-printed views
  - Advanced filtering by status (pending, in-progress, done)
  - Tag-based filtering with comma-separated tag lists
  - Full-text search across task titles and descriptions
  - Combinable filters for precise task selection

- **Command-Line Interface**
