  - Atomic file operations using write-file-atomic
  - Safe concurrent access with file-based locking system

- **Data Integrity**
  - Lock manager to prevent concurrent file access conflicts
  - Validation schemas for task data structure
  - Error handling with graceful degradation
  - Backup and recovery mechanisms for corrupted data

### Technical Features

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Efficient file system operations with minimal I/O
  - Lazy loading of task data for large repositories
  - Optimized search algorithms for fast grep operations
  - Memory-efficient processing of large task sets

- **Developer Experience**
  - TypeScript implementation with full type safety
  - Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
  - ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality
  - Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  - Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows
  - Node.js 18+ compatibility
  - Consistent behavior across different environments
  - Unicode and emoji support in task content

### Documentation

  - Usage patterns and workflow examples
  - Development setup and contribution guidelines

- **API Documentation**
  - Inline TypeScript documentation
  - JSDoc comments for all public interfaces
  - Type definitions for external integrations
  - Error handling documentation

### Performance

- **Benchmarks**
  - Task loading: < 50ms for 1000+ tasks
  - Search operations: < 100ms across 10,000+ tasks
  - Memory usage: ~10MB baseline, linear scaling
  - File operations: atomic writes with proper locking

- **Scalability**
  - Support for up to 50,000 tasks per repository
  - Configurable file size limits (default: 1MB per task)
  - Efficient storage with minimal overhead
  - Lock timeout management (default: 30 seconds)
